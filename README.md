# GUMP - Gamified User Management Platform

## What is this project about?

This project pretends to be the backend part of an online "learning to code" platform (Watch out Lane, I'm comming). After being a professor in technical degrees for computer science in Barcelona for 4 years, I detected a lack of platforms from 0 to basic level to help students and encourage them to program.
